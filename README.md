## Introduction

**Citronix** is a Java-based farm management application designed to help farmers efficiently manage lemon production, harvesting, and sales. The application provides tools to oversee farms, fields, trees, harvests, and sales, aiming to optimize productivity tracking based on tree age and seasonal yields.

The project adheres to a layered architecture, focusing on scalable and maintainable development practices, and is built with industry-standard tools and technologies.

---

## Project Context

The Citronix project involves:
- Managing farms, fields, trees, harvests, and sales data.
- Automating calculations such as tree productivity and farm revenue.
- Enforcing business rules like tree planting seasons and field size constraints.

---

## Features

### 1. Farm Management
- Create, update, delete, and view farm information (name, location, size, creation date).
- Perform multi-criteria searches using **CriteriaBuilder**.

### 2. Field Management
- Associate fields with farms and define their sizes.
- Ensure field size constraints:
    - Total field area must be less than the farm area.
    - Minimum size: 0.1 hectares (1,000 m²).
    - Maximum size: 50% of the farm area.
- Limit each farm to a maximum of 10 fields.

### 3. Tree Management
- Track trees by planting date, age, and associated field.
- Automatically calculate tree ages.
- Productivity based on age:
    - **Young Trees (<3 years)**: 2.5 kg/season.
    - **Mature Trees (3–10 years)**: 12 kg/season.
    - **Old Trees (>10 years)**: 20 kg/season.
- Enforce tree planting season (March to May).

### 4. Harvest Management
- Record harvests per season (winter, spring, summer, autumn).
- Restrict to one harvest per field per season.
- Track harvest details such as date and total quantity.

### 5. Harvest Details
- Associate each tree with a specific harvest.
- Track the quantity harvested per tree.

### 6. Sales Management
- Record sales with details such as date, unit price, client, and associated harvest.
- Calculate revenue: `Revenue = Quantity × Unit Price`.

### Project Architecture and Value-Added Components

The **Citronix** project follows a modular and scalable architecture, adhering to best practices for modern software development. This ensures maintainability, reusability, and adherence to industry standards.

---

#### 1. Service Layer
The service layer acts as the bridge between the controllers and the repositories. It encapsulates business logic and ensures a clean separation of concerns. Key highlights of the service layer include:
- **Business Logic**: Implements constraints like the maximum number of fields in a farm, validation of harvest seasons, and productivity calculations for trees based on age.
- **Centralized Exception Handling**: Ensures consistent error responses across the application.
- **Reusable Services**: Abstracts core operations like CRUD while applying business rules, making the application easy to maintain and extend.

---

#### 2. Repository Layer
The repository layer is designed for efficient database interactions using **Spring Data JPA**.
- **Custom Queries**: Implements custom JPA queries for complex use cases like fetching farms by location or calculating total revenue for specific seasons.
- **Criteria API**: Enables advanced search functionalities such as multi-criteria filtering for farms.
- **Encapsulation**: Hides the complexity of database interactions from higher layers.

---

#### 3. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
DTOs are used to transfer data between the client and the application.
- **Optimized Payloads**: Reduces the size of API responses by only including the necessary fields.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ensures the entities remain decoupled from API models, improving flexibility.
- **Validation Integration**: DTOs are validated using **Bean Validation** annotations, ensuring data integrity at the API boundary.

---

#### 4. ViewModels (VMs)
ViewModels provide a refined representation of entities for specific use cases like analytics and reporting.
- **Custom Formats**: Offers aggregated data like farm productivity, revenue reports, and harvest summaries.
- **Transformation Layer**: Built using **MapStruct** for seamless conversion from entities to ViewModels.

---

#### 5. Data Validation
Validation is a cornerstone of the project, ensuring that only valid data enters the system.
- **Spring Bean Validation**: Used for field-level validation such as minimum farm size, valid tree planting periods, and single harvest constraints per season.
- **Custom Validators**: Implements project-specific rules like tree density limits and productive age range validation for trees.

---

#### 6. Database Versioning with Liquibase
The project employs **Liquibase** for managing database schema changes in a controlled and traceable manner.
- **Change Logs**: Maintains a history of all database changes, including table creations, constraints, and seed data.
- **Rollback Support**: Enables easy reversion of changes if needed.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates team collaboration by ensuring that all developers work with the same database schema version.
- **Sample Changes**:
    - Table definitions for `Farm`, `Field`, `Tree`, `Harvest`, and `Sales`.
    - Constraints such as unique keys, foreign keys, and check constraints for business rules.
    - Seed data for initial testing and demonstrations.

---

#### Added Value of the Architecture
This layered architecture with well-defined components offers the following benefits:
1. **Scalability**: Each layer can evolve independently, making the project adaptable to future requirements.
2. **Maintainability**: Modular design allows easy debugging, testing, and updates.
3. **Performance Optimization**: DTOs and repositories ensure optimized database interactions and lightweight API responses.
4. **Data Integrity**: Validation and Liquibase ensure consistent and reliable data across the application.
5. **Developer Productivity**: Tools like MapStruct and Liquibase reduce boilerplate code and improve development speed.

This structured approach sets the **Citronix** project apart as a robust and professional solution for lemon farm management.
